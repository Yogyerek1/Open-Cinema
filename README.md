✍️ **OpenCinema** 🎥

OpenCinema is a modern full-stack Content Management System (CMS) 🖥️ designed for organizing and publishing media links from third-party providers. The platform allows for community-driven content submissions ✍️, managed through a built-in moderation workflow and an administrative dashboard 🛡️. The system does not host video files; it extracts technical identifiers from submitted URLs and uses them to dynamically embed external video players 🎥.
